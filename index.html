                    <p>
                        The OSC Chess Club was founded in 2010 by a group of students who shared a passion for chess. Since then, the club has grown to include players of all ages and skill levels. Our mission is to promote the game of chess and provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for players to enjoy the game. We believe that chess is a great way to develop critical thinking skills, improve concentration, and have fun. We are always looking for new members to join us, so if you are interested in chess, we would love to have you as part of our club.
