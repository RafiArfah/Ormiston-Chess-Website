                 <h2>What is Chess?</h2>
                 <p>
                 Chess is a two-player strategy game that is played on an 8x8 board. The game is played with 16 pieces for each player, including a king, queen, rooks, knights, bishops, and pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting the king in a position where it cannot escape capture.
                </p>
                <h2>How to Play Chess</h2>
                <p>
                Chess is a game of strategy and tactics. Each piece has its own unique movement pattern, and players must use their pieces to control the board and attack the opponent's pieces. The game is won by putting the opponent's king in checkmate, which means the king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape. For more information please refer to the video below.

                <p>
